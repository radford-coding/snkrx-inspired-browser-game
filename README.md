![snkrx icon](./images/snkrx-icon.jpeg)

#### [click to play!](https://radford-coding.github.io/snkrx-inspired-browser-game/)

Quick instructions for playing:
- settings in the top right:
    - control the snake using wasd/arrow keys or follow-mouse
    - audio on/muted
    - difficulty level
- avoid the enemies in each wave, and survive each arena to earn an upgrade. Choosing a new unit will add it to your snake; choosing an existing unit will make that unit more powerful. Speed and hp stack.
- Snake hp is in the bottom left, and a count of enemies is in the bottom right.
- Beat 5 increasingly difficult arenas to win!

A twist on the classic Snake, the original **autobattler roguelike** by [a327ex](https://store.steampowered.com/developer/a327ex) inspired this project.

#### Looking forward

While there are always more features that can be added (different unit types, enemy types, etc.), here are a few things I took away from this project that I'll use in the future:

1. Good planning saves refactoring/debugging time. I went into this project with a few hundred lines of pseudocode, and I wish I'd tripled that. Particularly on the flow of logic throughout the game, as having that scaffolding at the beginning would have made development far quicker.
2. This project was completed in 1 week - beginning planning on future projects earlier will be better, as the useful brainwaves come once everything is finished.
